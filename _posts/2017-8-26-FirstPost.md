Finally writing a blog! I'm writing this so that I don't forget things I'll learn and be as a reminder for me not to procrastinate.
In this blog, I intend to learn the working of Android and how you port an Android OS to a device. Here, I'll be using my phone(OnePlus 3) to port 
Android Oreo. I don't know whether this'll help. But I hope it does in reaching my goal of successful port.
